##Suggested Plan

1)	Introduction to supply chains
•	Definitions
•	Risk and disruption in supply chains
•	Push, pull. And hybrid systems
2)	Chemical reaction modelling: stochastic reaction networks
•	Definition of continuous time Markov chains and stochastic reaction network
•	Exact simulation methods: SSA, NRM, and MNRM
•	Approximate method: tau-leap method
•	Delayed approach: D-leap
3)	Analogy between supply chains and chemical reaction modelling
